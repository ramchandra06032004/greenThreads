                    favorite

                    highest standards for people and the planet in its
                    manufacturing process. As the name suggests, the company
                    plants 10 trees for each item purchased and has a goal
                    of
                    planting one billion trees by 2030. (The company has
                    planted
                    over 100 million trees to date!) The clothing is perfect
                    for
                    the activewear & loungewear lover (we love the men’s
                    joggers!), and everything is made from sustainable

                    that going organic has benefits for consumers, farmers, and
                    the planet. The brand’s organic cotton clothing uses up to
                    81 percent less water than traditional cotton, avoids the
                    use of chemicals, and is supremely softer than the
                    alternative—a true win-win for everyone involved. Our
                    personal favorites are the loungewear and sleepwear,
                    engineered for all-day (and night!) comfort, leaving you
